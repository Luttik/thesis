Generative artifcial intelligence (Generative AI) is one of the most groundbreaking and forward-thinking AI advancements in recent years (Kushwaha et al. [2021\)](#page-32-1). This discipline encompasses the development of intelligent machines capable of simulating human cognitive abilities (Pentina et al. [2023](#page-33-0)). This remarkable technology possesses the extraordinary potential to completely transform and reshape every aspect of modern life, as it can engage in complex cognitive processes such as thinking, reasoning, and decision-making, much like human beings. (Dwivedi et al. [2023a](#page-31-0), [b](#page-31-1)). Generative AI represents a category of artifcial intelligence technology characterized by machine learning systems that can produce several types of content, such as text, images, or code (Ramesh and Chawla [2022\)](#page-33-1). These systems typically respond to user prompts by generating content that simulates human-like output (Schuetzler et al. [2020\)](#page-33-2). The integration of Generative AI models is becoming more prevalent in online tools and chatbots, enabling users to input questions or instructions, with the AI generating responses that closely resemble human language (Dipaola et al. [2018](#page-31-2)). Acar ([2024\)](#page-30-0) underscores that Generative AI can transform marketing education by improving learning processes and resolving long-standing pedagogical challenges. The benefts span cost efectiveness, personalized approaches, and fostering creativity while calling for a thoughtful and strategic implementation approach. Similarly, Zhang and Prebensen [\(2024](#page-34-0)) explore the distinguishability and efcacy of tourism marketing materials created by ChatGPT versus traditional marketers, revealing that AI-generated content can achieve comparable levels of textual fuency and attractiveness, advocating for a co-creation relationship between AI and marketers. Bilgihan et al. ([2024\)](#page-31-3) provide a structured Generative AI marketing model, emphasizing personalization, customer engagement, and decision-making optimization while addressing ethical considerations in AI integration.

Generative AI chatbots utilize advanced deep learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to provide human-like text responses, showcasing improved natural language understanding (NLU) capabilities, reduced biases, and enhanced contextual comprehension (Jiang et al. [2023](#page-32-2); Srivastava and Prabhakar [2019](#page-34-1)). A signifcant portion of organizations, around 60 percent among AI adopters, now regularly integrate Generative AI into various functions, refecting its widespread adoption and utility. These chatbots leverage sophisticated deep learning methodologies, particularly relying on GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) models, to interpret user input, context, and intent, crafting suitable and contextually ftting textual replies (Koc et al. [2023](#page-32-3)).

GAI ofers practical tools for creative tasks across industries, like marketing and content creation. As organizations increasingly leverage Generative AI in their marketing endeavors, they unlock new dimensions of creativity and efciency (Kar et al. [2023](#page-32-4)). This transformative technology opens new horizons by infusing marketing strategies with unique efciency and innovation (Saydam et al. [2022](#page-33-3)). Sands et al. ([2024\)](#page-33-4) provide six principles for responsible advertising using AI, emphasizing transparency, ethical guidelines, and accountability to balance innovation with responsible practices. The integration of AI allows for the automation of tasks that conventionally necessitate human cognitive abilities, paving the way for enhanced decision-making, personalized customer experiences, and

![](_page_1_Picture_4.jpeg)

streamlined processes within the marketing domain (Orchard and Tasiemski [2023\)](#page-33-5). Companies can enhance human creativity and spur innovation through Generative AI, restructuring operations, crafting compelling marketing initiatives, identifying fraud, and producing lifelike virtual agents (Bakkouri et al. [2022\)](#page-30-1). With the right applications and data, businesses can explore new avenues, mitigate risks, update production, and automate tasks, resulting in groundbreaking solutions and costefective outcomes (Korzynski et al. [2023](#page-32-5)). It helps organizations achieve their goals within a shorter period. Chatbots driven by artifcial intelligence are designed to engage in conversations that mimic human interactions through NLP (Fu et al. [2023](#page-31-4)). Through NLP, these AI chatbots can comprehend written human language, allowing them to function autonomously to a signifcant extent (Ameen et al. [2022;](#page-30-2) Calvaresi et al. [2023\)](#page-31-5) Chatbots with these anthropomorphic characteristics will signifcantly impact the modern business world (Youn and Cho [2023\)](#page-34-2).

The utilization of Generative AI in marketing has received considerable scholarly and practical attention due to its fast advancement. Knowing the current state of research and identifying areas that need further investigation is crucial to develop an agenda for future investigations. Hence, the current article systematically reviews Generative AI's research landscapes in marketing, using the TCCM (Theory, Context, Characteristics, and Methodology) framework to evaluate and classify the existing studies. Further, it analyses the theoretical foundations, practical uses, unique features, and research methods that have infuenced the existing literature. The study provides a comprehensive overview of the current research and a solid basis for developing a unifed framework to direct future studies in this area. This study aims to achieve three main objectives: to analyze the current state of Generative AI research in marketing, to identify areas for further investigation, to identify the gaps and opportunities for future inquiry, and to propose a conceptual framework to enhance the knowledge in this area. Formulating potential research questions and establishing a conceptual framework aims to provide novel perspectives and methodologies to enhance the feld.

The outcomes of this study ofer a thorough overview of the current research and future research directions for researchers of Generative AI within the marketing domain. This aids them in identifying gaps in research by being aware of the existing works in this feld and planning their forthcoming studies. Moreover, the fndings of the TCCM framework furnish the readers with various theories, contexts, characteristics, and methodologies employed in previous studies. Consequently, they can better understand the existing literature on Generative AI in marketing and its implications from this study.

*Research in Interactive Marketing* are the most productive journals of 2023 having two to three publications. Interestingly, 49% of the journals in this dataset have published only one article, of which 51% were published in 2023 and 2024, refecting the growing interest in this emerging feld. The *Journal of Business Research* and *Electronic Commerce Research and Applications* stand out for their consistent contributions, publishing at least one article annually since 2020.

## **4.3 Phase # 1 TCCM framework: theory (T)**

Table [2](#page-10-0) categorizes and quantifes the theories used in the 104 articles focusing on Generative AI in marketing research. It reveals a signifcant reliance on theoretical frameworks, with 66 articles (63%) grounded in theory, highlighting the importance of theoretical underpinnings in understanding Generative AI's role in marketing. However, the 38 articles (37%) lacking explicit theoretical frameworks suggest that there is still room for exploratory and descriptive studies in this rapidly evolving feld. The frequent use of Anthropomorphism Theory in six articles underscores the profound impact of human-like features in AI on consumer interactions and perceptions. This theory suggests that when AI mimics human traits, it can signifcantly enhance user engagement and trust, as noted by Klein and Martinez ([2022\)](#page-32-12). This trend points to an increasing acknowledgment of the psychological subtleties in human-AI interactions, especially regarding how consumers connect with and accept AI technologies. Social Presence Theory (SPT) is utilized in fve articles, which could indicate the importance of the chatbot's perceived presence in afecting user experience (Schuetzler et al. [2020](#page-33-2)). This theory suggests that the more socially present an AI feels, the more efective it is in engaging users, thereby enhancing satisfaction and loyalty. This underscores the critical role of perceived social presence in the design and implementation of AI-driven marketing tools. Innovation Adoption and Social Response Theory are used in 4 articles, which suggest that these theories are central to understanding how consumers adopt and respond to chatbot technologies, highlighting the importance of designing AI that aligns with consumer expectations and social norms (Kushwaha et al. [2021;](#page-32-1) Kull et al. [2021\)](#page-32-6). The application of Uncanny Valley Theory highlights the fne balance needed when designing AI that is human-like but not unsettling. This theory, along with the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and Unifed Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), is mostly used in e-commerce and service sector studies, emphasizing the factors that infuence user acceptance and the usability of AI technologies. These theories highlight the complexities of human-technology interactions and the importance of user-friendly design in enhancing the adoption of Generative AI (Song and Shin [2022](#page-34-8); Shin et al. [2023](#page-33-15)). The application of Afordance Theory, Cognitive Appraisal Theory, and Grounded Theory illustrates a comprehensive approach to examining the varied efects of Generative AI. These theories explore user perceptions and interactions with AI, emotional responses, and contextual infuences, highlighting the complex relationship between technology design, user perception, and context (Vassilakopoulou et al. [2023](#page-34-9); Shin et al. [2023](#page-33-15); Maragno et al. [2022\)](#page-33-16). The use of diverse theories in these studies emphasizes the complexity of integrating

Businesses may enhance their customer journey by strategically identifying and highlighting important interaction places on a map, allowing them to take advantage of timely opportunities (Chung et al [2020\)](#page-31-11). Social media, online advertisements, digital marketing content, peer referrals, product catalogs, e-commerce, etc., are some examples of customer touchpoints. Information quality, service quality, communication quality, and competence infuence customer touchpoints while using Generative AI in marketing. Information quality ensures the content is more reliable, informative, and meets the user's needs (Zhu et al. [2023b](#page-34-15)). Service quality emphasizes the excellence and reliability of the services ofered by Generative AI and evaluates how well these services meet customer expectations and deliver value. Communication quality is another crucial factor in that the messages conveyed by Generative AI are easily understandable and align with the brand's communication standards (Chung et al. [2020\)](#page-31-11). The ability of the Generative AI system to interact in a manner perceived as socially competent is considered the technology's communication competence. Kushwaha et al. [\(2021](#page-32-1)) identifed touchpoints and specifc factors, like perceived risk, brand trustworthiness, and sensory appeal, as antecedents in Generative AI in marketing studies. All these factors defne the customer experience at various touchpoints, infuencing satisfaction and trust in Generative AI-driven marketing interactions.

### **4.6 Phase # 4 TCCM framework: methodologies (M)**

Table [5](#page-22-0) summarises the research design characteristics of the articles reviewed for the study, presenting the number of articles and the percentage of each method's representation. The reviewed articles on Generative AI in marketing predominantly utilize quantitative methods, with 55% (57 out of 104) favoring this approach. This preference underscores the industry's reliance on numerical data and statistical analysis in Generative AI research, especially within fashion brands and the tourism sector. Survey-based approaches are utilized in 21 articles by which the researchers collected data through standardized questionnaires, and 36 articles adopted experimental designs, often incorporating Social Presence Theory to examine the psychological efects of Generative AI in social interactions. Qualitative methods were applied in 19 articles, employing interviews, case studies, and thematic analysis. Thematic analysis, used in 11 of these studies, proved essential for identifying patterns and themes within qualitative data, providing depth that quantitative methods alone might not capture. The use of a mixed-method approach was less common, seen in only 2 articles, suggesting a potential area for further research that combines the strengths of both qualitative and quantitative approaches. Twenty-six articles employed a range of unspecifed methodologies, refecting the methodological diversity within the feld. This analysis highlights the dominant research methods and points to opportunities where future studies could beneft from employing more integrated and varied approaches.

### **5.1 Novel theoretical perspectives**

Future research studies of Generative AI in marketing will determine the extent and signifcance of a theory based on the unique research questions, study setting, and the advancing capabilities of Generative AI technologies. However, this study found a few notable theories for their wide-ranging relevance and capacity to provide valuable insights in the age of Generative AI in marketing. TAM and UTAUT are crucial theories for understanding the adaptability of Generative AI tools by consumers and marketers, highlighting the importance of examining factors infuencing acceptance and resistance as these technologies become more sophisticated. For example, future research could investigate how perceived usefulness and ease of use afect marketers' adoption intentions and how social infuence impacts the acceptance of Generative AI among consumers in diferent marketing contexts. Human-like interactions emphasize the need for anthropomorphism theory, which gives a clear understanding of consumer views on Generative AI traits. This theory is crucial for understanding consumer perceptions of human-like interactions with Generative AI. It provides insights into how anthropomorphic qualities of Generative AI afect consumer engagement, decision-making, and emotional connections with brands. Research could explore how diferent demographic groups respond to anthropomorphism in marketing Generative AI and how these features impact consumer trust and brand loyalty. The SOR model assesses the impact of Generative AI on consumer responses and emphasizes its signifcance for customized marketing. It examines how stimuli from Generative AI afect consumer emotions and behaviors, highlighting the signifcance of these technologies in enhancing marketing strategies. The changing trust of customers in Generative AI is examined through the trust theory and is important for understanding how trust in Generative AI afects consumer behavior and decision-making. Future research could investigate the factors infuencing trust in Generative AI and how marketers can build and maintain this trust through transparent and ethical practices. Afordance theory suggests a way to enhance Generative AI marketing techniques by identifying the possibilities and limitations of Generative AI technologies. It provides a framework by identifying the possibilities and limitations of Generative AI technologies. It provides a framework for exploring how Generative AI can leveraged to create more efective and innovative marketing strategies. CASA theory is a crucial theory that analyses human-AI-social interactions and is essential for designing engaging Generative AI experiences. It investigates how social cues from Generative AI, such as conversational style and tone, afect consumer engagement and satisfaction (Jin and Eastin [2023\)](#page-32-15). Research could explore how Generative AI can emulate human social behaviors to foster more meaningful and personalized consumer interactions. The intersection of these theories suggests a multidisciplinary research approach, which is best suited for a comprehensive understanding of the complex dynamics of Generative AI in marketing. By integrating insights from various theoretical perspectives, future research can navigate the rapidly advancing technological landscape and shifting consumer expectations, ultimately enhancing the efectiveness and ethical implementation of Generative AI in marketing practices.

### **5.2 Unexplored research settings**

The study identifed a major gap in the research of Generative AI in marketing between developed and developing countries, with the latter receiving comparatively less focus. This gap highlights the urgent need for cross-cultural and international research to investigate how cultural diferences afect the integration and efectiveness of Generative AI in marketing strategies. Future research must thoroughly examine the impact of cultural elements on marketing strategies and the adaptation of Generative AI technology to diferent cultural backgrounds. Future studies should explore how Generative AI can tailor marketing strategies for a more personalized experience in the tourism sector, including creating engaging and SEO-friendly marketing content and boosting sustainable tourism through customized advertising and marketing. Generative AI could generate personalized travel itineraries and dynamic pricing strategies that adapt to individual preferences, enhancing customer satisfaction and operational efciency (Dogru et al. [2023\)](#page-31-6). Similarly, research should investigate the role of Generative AI in tailoring fashion recommendations to elevate customer shopping experiences, including forecasting fashion trends and customer preferences efectively. Generative AI can help designers explore innovative concepts and create complex patterns, ultimately promoting originality and diversity in fashion collections. The virtual try-on tools powered by Generative AI can make online shopping more interactive and personalized (Dwivedi et al. [2023a\)](#page-31-0). The hotel industry can beneft signifcantly from Generative AI by transforming content creation for marketing purposes. Future research should focus on how Generative AI can forecast hotel booking trends to inform marketing strategies, enhancing guest satisfaction through personalized recommendations and efcient resource utilization (Jin and Youn [2023](#page-32-11)). In the e-commerce sector, Generative AI has the potential to revolutionize operations by automating and improving content creation for product descriptions, images, and videos (Dwivedi et al. [2023b\)](#page-31-1). Future studies should explore how Generative AI can efectively anticipate and adjust to real-time consumer trends on e-commerce platforms, enhancing user engagement and increasing sales through AI-powered recommendation engines and real-time customer support (Zhu et al. [2023c\)](#page-34-10). Additionally, cross-cultural research is essential to understand how Generative AI can be adapted to various cultural contexts, examining consumer insights from advanced and emerging markets to identify creative marketing opportunities (Cheng et al. [2022;](#page-31-13) David-Ignatief et al. [2023\)](#page-31-18).

### **5.3 Original constructs and relationships**

The conceptual framework presented in Fig. [4](#page-28-0) ofers an organized structure for examining the efects of Generative AI in marketing, making it a valuable area for future research. This framework integrates variables derived from previous studies and new contributions from the author, categorized under antecedents, mediators, moderators, and outcomes. These variables are further grouped into

<span id="page-28-0"></span>**Fig. 4** A conceptual framework for generative AI in marketing research

individual-related, organizational and environmental-related, product or servicerelated, and technology-related themes. According to the conceptual framework, certain antecedent factors, like an individual's technology enthusiasm, can enhance the perceived benefts, such as the usefulness or friendliness of Generative AI, and act as mediators in this relationship. These mediators have a signifcant impact on the outcome variables like customer trust and customer satisfaction (Jin and Youn [2023](#page-32-11)). The framework also highlights the role of moderators that can infuence or strengthen these relationships. Privacy concerns can be used as an obvious representation of a factor that can alter the intensity or the nature of the relationship between those antecedents and outcomes. For example, high privacy concerns could potentially diminish the otherwise positive impact of Generative AI's perceived ease of use on customer satisfaction.

The variables proposed in this framework in Fig. [4](#page-28-0) are instrumental in guiding future research within the domain of Generative AI in marketing. By incorporating existing and new variables, the study intends to expand upon established knowledge and suggest new directions for investigations, emphasizing the feld's evolving nature. These combined elements create a strong platform for academic inquiry, ofering a proactive approach to the potential infuence of Generative AI on marketing strategies and outcomes. The proposed framework can generate hypotheses for empirical testing, fostering a deeper understanding of the dynamics involved in integrating Generative AI in the marketing context.

This framework opens several avenues for future research, such as exploring how the use of Generative AI in marketing shapes consumer perceptions and infuences brand authenticity. Other areas of interest include evaluating its impacts on the efectiveness and efciency of marketing campaigns, particularly in terms of return

on investment (ROI) and conversion rates. Researchers could also examine the psychological efects of AI-generated personalized marketing on consumer-decision making and investigate how generative AI can enhance customer experiences across digital touchpoints, ultimately boosting engagement and satisfaction. These inquiries underscore the potential of Generative AI to revolutionize marketing practices, ofering valuable insights for academics and industry.

### **5.4 Innovative data and methods**

This study fnds that most existing research on Generative AI in marketing relies heavily on either quantitative or qualitative studies, with only 2% employing a mixed-method approach. This indicates a signifcant opportunity for future studies to adopt more comprehensive methodologies that combine quantitative and qualitative research strengths. For instance, longitudinal studies integrating extensive qualitative observations with empirical quantitative hypothesis testing can provide a deeper understanding of the phenomena. Quantitative methodologies, such as experimental designs, are essential for assessing how Generative AI-generated content infuences consumer purchase intentions compared to human-generated content and determining whether the personalization of Generative AI can enhance the efectiveness of email marketing campaigns in terms of open rates and conversions. Surveys can further explain the correlation between changes in brand perception and engagement with Generative AI-driven marketing campaigns.

Qualitative methodologies, including interviews and case studies, are invaluable for exploring consumer perceptions of the authenticity of marketing content produced by Generative AI and investigating the ethical concerns associated with the adoption of Generative AI in marketing. Case studies, in particular, can provide detailed insights into marketers' challenges and experiences when incorporating Generative AI into their strategies. Combining quantitative and qualitative techniques, a mixed-method approach is crucial for gaining a holistic view of Generative AI's impact on marketing. For example, such an approach can help understand the efects of Generative AI on consumer decision-making processes in online shopping environments, ofering a more detailed perspective on how Generative AI technologies infuence consumer behavior and marketing efectiveness. This comprehensive approach will address the existing research gap and enhance the theoretical and practical understanding of Generative AI's role in transforming marketing practices.

### **6 Conclusion**

and efciency. However, the review also identifes several challenges and ethical considerations that must be addressed to ensure the responsible use of Generative AI in marketing. By integrating the fndings from the literature review with the TCCM framework, we propose a conceptual framework that can guide future studies in this feld. This framework includes variables such as individual-related, organizational and environmental-related, product or service-related, and technology-related themes, ofering a structured approach to studying the impact of Generative AI on marketing. The study also proposes several future research directions, emphasizing the need for cross-cultural studies, mixed-method approaches, and longitudinal studies to capture the long-term efects of Generative AI on marketing practices. The outcome of this study provides a robust foundation for advancing knowledge in the feld of Generative AI in marketing, ofering valuable insights for researchers, marketers, and businesses. By addressing the gaps and opportunities identifed in this study, future research can contribute to a deeper understanding of the dynamics involved in integrating into marketing strategies, ultimately driving innovation and efciency in the feld.
