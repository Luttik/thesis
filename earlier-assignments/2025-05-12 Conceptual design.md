# **Introduction**

Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI)  is often seen as the replacement for a vast array of knowledge jobs (Bessen, 2018). However, in marketing (and arguably in many other domains), AI still mainly serves as a question and answer machine or a brainstorming assistant, rather than a system that can really do the work, or make a meaningful contribution to a vast amount of normal daily tasks (Brinker & Riemersma, 2025, p. 35).  
In many organizations, understanding protocols and best-practices (whether written or unwritten), systems, and tools that are available is crucial in the everyday work. This is a crucial part of the typical onboarding program for humans. Therefore, it makes sense that AI, whether in the form of an autonomous agent or work-enhancing assistant, should have a similar context to provide the best output.  
Over the last year, various frameworks and protocols have been developed to enable to integrate with other systems, enabling them to gather context for themselves, and even act. A clear example is the Model Context Protocol (MCP) as introduced by Anthropic (2024), which is quickly becoming the de facto standard of integrating agents with the systems that have access too.   
However, there is a lot that needs to happen, both technologically and on the business and organizational level, for the full potential of these innovations to materialize (Mayer et al., 2025). In many ways, this process is transformative to business, and might be comparable to the digital transformation of the last decades (Mayer et al., 2025).

# **Management Problem**

Marketing & Sales might be the largest opportunity for use of AI, representing about one-third of the expected market cap of AI application (Mayer et al., 2025). Use cases that are often noted revolve around content creation using AI. In addition to these possibilities, there will be many new possibilities now that Agentic AI is increasingly effective (Brinker & Riemersma, 2025, p. 4).  
Marketing as a domain has also evolved rapidly over the last 15 years. Marketing Technology (often shortened to Martech) is being used to automate and personalize not just communications, but also many other interactions that the consumer has with an organization. The impact is broad, ranging from techniques like content-recommendation, to email-automation, and ads-optimization.   
Additionally, the impact of the corresponding processes are increasingly measurable, creating the option to keep learning, improve processes, and through that improve the customer experience or business value.  
As marketing has become increasingly technology and process focussed (Elwell, 2024), it could be argued that the impact of Agentic AI on marketing might be even larger than the impact than the creation of content. Agentic AI can be leveraged by marketeers to do their own work more efficiently. However, at this point, 72% of marketeers indicate that their company is still only experimenting with AI or using it in a very limited fashion (Brinker & Riemersma, 2025, p. 33).   
Personal communications indicate that while many expect the benefits of AI to be impactful, they do not yet know how to leverage it, or even where to start. Additionally, from a managerial perspective, it is highly relevant to know how you can prepare your organization for the efficient rollout of relevant AI use cases.

# **Conceptualization**

Our objective with this research is to explore how marketing departments can create value with generative AI with a particular focus on agentic AI. 

## **Concepts to support the research**

There are various concepts and frameworks that we can utilize in researching our area of focus. An important one is the concept of “value” (Sidorchuk, 2015).  
In many ways, the rollout of AI is a new wave of digital transformation (Holmström, 2022). The various methodologies and frameworks developed for digital transformation are relevant to consider when evaluating the impact of generative AI.  
There are various lenses that we can consider to analyze this topic with. Including technology-in-practice (Orlikowisk, 1999), service dominant logic (Vargo & Lusch, 2017), and dynamic capabilities (Teece et al., 1997). It is likely that, due to the rapid rate of change in this field, the lens of dynamic capabilities is the best fit for our topic.

## **Research method**

The question “how can” is exploratory in nature, and therefore best covered by qualitative research. Since many managers do not yet know how they should leverage AI to the fullest, a model combining both interviews with AI experts and interviews with marketing managers will be used. The latter group will be scoped broadly, both marketing managers, CMOs, and CEOs who are involved with the marketing process will be considered. This approach will help us combine the experience from the marketing domain, with the suggestions and ideas from the AI experts.  
Due to the emerging nature of AI in business, utilizing a grounded theory (Glaser & Strauss, 1999\) approach seems sensible.  In line with Vidal et al. (2022) in-depth interviews will be applied, using both purposive sampling and chain referral sampling, afterwards, theory can be derived by first identifying first-order themes and then extracting higher-order concepts from those themes.

# **Research Problem**

The main research question is as follows: *“How can marketing managers create value with generative AI?”* within that board scope, I want to give a particular focus on Agentic AI. In researching this question, we will answer various sub-questions, within the scope of applying generative AI to the marketing domain like. For instance, to find area’s for potential value, the question *“What are the most valuable use cases?”* is highly relevant. Additionally, to be able to counteract issues that might prevent value from being obtained, the question *“What are the main obstacles?”* will be analyzed. Furthermore, to extract best-practices and additional unexpected insights, the question *“What are the key drivers for success?”* is posed.  
The objective behind these question is to help marketing professionals leverage the potential AI to generate more value for their companies.

# **Intended academic contributions**

The research on generative AI within the marketing domain is limited, and the technology is evolving rapidly, warranting constant reevaluation of the options. However, most that combines AI and marketing focusses on content generation, many other applications of AI within marketing seem to be largely uncovered.

## **The research gap regarding Agentic AI in marketing**

Well before the revolutionary impact of the transformer model (Vaswani et al., 2017), which was the basis for products like ChatGPT (hence, GPT stands for Generative Pretrainded Transformer), Alonso (2002) already noted that research in AI should really focus on agent-based AI. A defining feature for agents is autonomy, or more specifically, “the ability of the system to make their own decisions and execute tasks on the designer’s behalf. Delegating some responsibilities to the system…”.   
After the introduction of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) by Anthropic (2024) the Agents as described by Alonso (2002) based on generative AI are rapidly being adopted. Anthropic own overview already lists 120 officially supported available MCP servers, indicating that at least 120 companies already provided the means of integration between their software and various AI tools (Antanavicius et al., 2025). This is in addition to any unlisted, or community created integration, of which there are many more. Regardless of the vast impact that agentic AI seems to have, after searching the top-5 articles (ignoring articles that require purchasing) on Google Scholar for “AI marketing” and “AI agent marketing” not one mention of agents was made in relation to a system that can perform actions. Indicating a significant gap in the research.  
We want to focus on the value of generative AI in marketing. And we expect that the aforementioned agentic AI will take a very prominent role.

# **Intended practical contributions**

Through this research, marketing managers and practitioners should get a better perspective on how generative AI can be leveraged to improve their business performance through value generation. Not just in theory, but grounded in the experience of practitioners and the input of experts. Through this research opportunities, best-practices, obstacles and ways to counteract that should be identified.  
Together, this should help accelerate the marketing domain towards the broader potential that generative AI holds.
