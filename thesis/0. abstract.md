Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) represents a significant opportunity for marketing, with estimates suggesting it could account for approximately one-third of AI's total market impact. Much has been written about AI's impact on content generation and brainstorming. However, AI can also meaningfully contribute to the broader spectrum of marketing tasks, including topics like data-analysis, personalisation, automation, and more. In doing so AI can unlock even more value. 
This thesis explores this topic with the question: *How do marketing managers create value with generative AI?*, with particular emphasis on emerging agentic AI systems that possess contextual awareness and tool access capabilities.

This study addresses a critical gap in academic literature by examining GenAI applications in marketing beyond content generation, particularly in the underexplored domain of agentic systems. The research employs grounded theory, utilizing in-depth interviews with both AI experts and marketing professionals, to investigate the potential of AI to drive more value in marketing by driving real change to how typical marketing tasks are performed.
