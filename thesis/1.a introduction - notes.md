# Introduction

## AI as a digital transformation

- Use of AI
- Infrastructure
- Literacy

  - Context engineering
  - Awarness of options

- Setup for experimentation

## Definitions:

### Flow of AI

- AI
- Machine Learning

  - Different forms of analytics (descriptive, prescriptive, and predictive?)

- Deep learning
- GenAI

  - GenAI nowadays is pretrained (Generative Pretrained Transformer) while it can "learn" live this is mainly it's context updating with new insights, not updating the underlying network

- AI Agents [link](https://consensus.app/search/ai-agent-actions-explained/0dYzKe-wS863mdiRMQoxeQ/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=clipboard)

  - Analysis counts as an action 🥳

ø- Agentic AI [link](https://consensus.app/search/define-agentic-ai/e8ZzdGLBQo6eiWVZW_mSDw/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=clipboard)

### Value

- Pyramid of value (Harvard Business review paper)
- Arch g. Woodside et al.
  - $\text{Value} = \frac{\text{relative sum of weighted benefits perceived}}{\text{relative total cost perceived}}$
  - $\text{Value} = \text{relative sum of weighted benefits perceived} - \text{relative total cost perceived}$
  - ... (more in paper, including which to use when)
  - "most customers will set a minimum level of total bennefit ... cost savings"... (makes me think of satisfisers and maximisers.)
  - "Discontinuous innovations..."
  - Fig. 7 is interesting (input to customer value assessment)
  - Total cost of ownership (Acquisition, use, and disposal of a good or service over the lifetime of the purchase)
- Curious what behavioral economics would say about Woodside's approach, it seems to give too much authority to the user.

## Contribution

We strive contribute by...

## Is it really relevant

- AI driven "synthetic teams"

## Potentially interesting

- Decrease in entry level jobs [@brynjolfssonetal2025]
  - This might result in lack of pipeline of junior employees, and therefore senior employees in the future.
- Before transformer models, most ML models were not pretrained, this drastically affects the potential for addoption in low-cost scenarios
