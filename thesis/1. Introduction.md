# Introduction

## Background and Context

Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) has emerged as one of the most transformative technologies of the 21st century, with profound implications across industries and professional domains. In the business landscape, marketing and sales are positioned at the forefront of this transformation, representing approximately one-third of the expected market capitalization of AI technologies [@mayer2025]. This substantial market opportunity reflects both the potential of GenAI to revolutionize marketing practices and the pressing need for marketing managers to understand how to harness this technology effectively.

The discourse surrounding AI in marketing has predominantly focused on its applications in content generation and brainstorming activities [@brinker2025, p. 35]. While these capabilities have demonstrated value, they represent only a fraction of marketing's daily operational requirements. Current implementations of GenAI largely function as sophisticated question-and-answer systems, supporting creative processes but falling short of making meaningful contributions to the broader spectrum of marketing tasks such as data analysis, personalization, automation, and strategic decision-making. This limited application leaves significant value on the table and underutilizes the true potential of GenAI in marketing contexts.

Recent technological developments are beginning to address this limitation. Emerging agentic AI systems—characterized by their contextual awareness, tool access capabilities, and autonomous decision-making abilities—represent a paradigm shift in how AI can support marketing operations. These systems possess the potential to move beyond passive support tools toward active participants in marketing workflows, capable of executing complex tasks, integrating with existing marketing technology stacks, and adapting to dynamic business environments.

## Research Problem and Gap

Despite the significant attention paid to GenAI in both academic literature and practitioner discourse, a critical gap exists in understanding how marketing managers can systematically leverage GenAI to create value beyond content generation. The academic literature has not yet adequately explored the applications of agentic AI systems in marketing contexts, particularly regarding their integration into daily marketing operations and their potential to transform core marketing processes.

This gap is particularly significant given the rapid evolution of AI technologies. Marketing managers face the challenge of navigating an increasingly complex landscape of AI capabilities without clear frameworks or empirical evidence to guide their decision-making. The question of how to sense relevant opportunities, seize them effectively, and transform organizational capabilities to embed AI into operations remains largely unexplored in academic research.

Furthermore, the existing literature on digital transformation, while valuable, does not fully account for the unique characteristics of GenAI and agentic systems. In many ways, the rollout of AI represents a new wave of digital transformation [@holmstrom2022], yet the dynamic and rapidly evolving nature of GenAI technologies requires fresh perspectives and frameworks tailored to this specific technological context.

## Research Question and Objectives

This thesis addresses the identified gap by exploring the central research question:

**"How do marketing managers create value with generative AI?"**

With particular emphasis on emerging agentic AI systems, this research seeks to move beyond the narrow focus on content generation to examine the broader spectrum of value creation opportunities available to marketing managers. The question is deliberately exploratory in nature, acknowledging that the field is still emerging and that both theoretical understanding and practical guidance are needed.

To address this overarching question, the research pursues several specific objectives:

1. To identify and categorize the key opportunities for marketing managers to create value with GenAI across different marketing functions and processes
2. To understand how marketing organizations can systematically sense, seize, and transform their capabilities to leverage GenAI opportunities
3. To examine the practical challenges and success factors associated with implementing agentic AI systems in marketing contexts
4. To develop actionable insights that enable marketing managers to operate their departments more efficiently and create greater value through GenAI

## Theoretical Framework

This research employs the lens of dynamic capabilities [@teece1997] to examine how marketing organizations can respond to the rapidly evolving GenAI landscape. Dynamic capabilities—defined as the firm's ability to integrate, build, and reconfigure internal and external competencies to address rapidly changing environments—provide a particularly relevant framework for understanding AI adoption in marketing.

The framework's three core components structure the investigation:

**Sensing** involves identifying opportunities and threats in the environment. This research explores how marketing managers can develop capabilities to recognize high-value GenAI opportunities and assess their relevance for specific organizational contexts.

**Seizing** concerns mobilizing resources to capture value from identified opportunities. The research examines best practices that marketing managers can apply to effectively implement GenAI solutions and realize their potential benefits.

**Transforming** addresses the continuous renewal of organizational capabilities. This research investigates how skills, workflows, and marketing technology stacks can be reconfigured to embed agentic AI into day-to-day operations sustainably.

This theoretical lens is complemented by concepts from value theory [@sidorchuk2015] and digital transformation literature, providing a comprehensive framework for understanding value creation with GenAI in marketing contexts.

## Research Approach

Given the exploratory nature of the research question and the emerging character of agentic AI in marketing, this study adopts a qualitative research approach grounded in grounded theory methodology [@glaser1999]. The research employs in-depth interviews with two key stakeholder groups: AI experts who possess deep technical knowledge of GenAI capabilities, and marketing professionals (including marketing managers, Chief Marketing Officers, and CEOs involved in marketing processes) who bring domain expertise and practical experience.

This dual perspective is essential for bridging the gap between technological possibility and practical application. Following the methodology employed by @vidal2022, the research uses both purposive sampling and chain referral sampling to identify interview participants. The analysis proceeds through identification of first-order themes from the interview data, followed by extraction of higher-order concepts that inform theory development.

## Significance and Contributions

This research makes several important contributions to both academic knowledge and management practice.

**Academic contributions** include:
- Addressing the gap in literature regarding GenAI applications in marketing beyond content generation
- Providing empirical insights into the emerging domain of agentic AI systems in marketing contexts
- Extending dynamic capabilities theory to the specific context of GenAI adoption in marketing
- Contributing to the broader discourse on digital transformation by examining a new technological wave

**Practical contributions** include:
- Providing marketing managers with frameworks and insights to identify valuable GenAI opportunities
- Offering guidance on best practices for implementing and scaling GenAI initiatives in marketing organizations
- Supporting more informed decision-making regarding marketing technology investments and organizational change
- Enabling marketing departments to operate more efficiently and create greater value through strategic GenAI adoption
