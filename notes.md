# Notes

## About the interviews

- How much should the interviewees understand about the theoretical concepts? Should I explain things before starting?
- Should I just fully drop the dynamic capabilities perspective? (or make it very much a background thing?)

## From class

- Build a chain of evidence. With appendix.
  - Concent forms
  - Documents of meetings
  - Etc.


## AI in the pyramid of value

- Can AI really improve all elements of the functional layer? And many of the ones above?
